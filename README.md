# Interactive Children's Adventure Engine

An AI-powered storytelling engine designed to create personalized, therapeutic, and magical adventures for children. This project aims to turn stories into tools for growth, connection, and emotional learning.

## âœ¨ Core Features

This engine is being built to support:

* **Deep Personalization:** Stories are crafted around a child's name, age, interests, and real-life challenges.
* **Multi-Character Support:** Adventures can include siblings, friends, and even pets to model positive social interactions.
* **Therapeutic Focus:** Gently explores themes like confidence, empathy, handling fear, and conflict resolution in a safe, magical context.
* **Interactive & Linear Modes:** Can generate classic, linear tales or "choose-your-own-path" interactive adventures.
* **Printable Keepsakes:** Designed to output stories, "Wisdom Gems," and coloring page prompts that can be turned into downloadable PDF adventure packs.

## ðŸš€ Project Vision & Roadmap

This repository contains the foundational code for the story engine. The long-term vision is to build this into a full-fledged application.

* **Phase 1: Core Logic (Complete)** - A functional command-line script that proves the story generation logic.
* **Phase 2: AI Integration** - Connect the engine to a powerful LLM (like Google's Gemini API) to generate dynamic, high-quality narratives.
* **Phase 3: Web Application** - Build a user-friendly web interface where parents and educators can easily create and save stories.
* **Phase 4: Advanced Features** - Implement read-aloud functionality, interactive story maps, and automated PDF generation.
